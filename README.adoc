# Ethereum Kubernetes Sandbox

The purpose of the project is to simplify the process of launching a private Ethereum cluster, with the main use case
 which is testing Ethereum protocol modifications, private Dapp testing or for running a private blockchain. This is a forked version of ethereumproject/etherkube, modified to accomodate a Clique PoA Byzantium network, for use in Byzantium (and newer) dApp testing as well as scalability testing (my use case).
